üõ°Ô∏è PhishNet ‚Äì Phishing Website Detection using ML & Deep Learning
PhishNet is a powerful web-based phishing detection system that uses Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and SVM to classify websites as legitimate ‚úÖ or phishing üö® based on 30 key features. The system is fully deployed via a Streamlit web app with live prediction, batch processing, and visualizations.

üîç Problem Statement
Phishing prediction is the task of identifying and predicting the likelihood of a website, email, or message being a phishing attempt. Several challenges arise in building a phishing detection system:
#Diversity of Attacks ‚Äì Evolving, social engineering, brand mimicry.
#Imbalanced Data ‚Äì Far fewer phishing samples than legitimate ones.
#Lack of Ground Truth ‚Äì Phishing sites are taken down quickly.
#Limited Access to Data ‚Äì Proprietary or sensitive in nature.
#Feature Engineering ‚Äì Selecting generalizable and robust features.

üöÄ Proposed Work
This project addresses the above challenges through a streamlined deep learning-based solution with multiple model comparisons.

‚úÖ Project Workflow:
-Dataset Acquisition: Downloaded phishing dataset from Kaggle.
-Preprocessing: Cleaned data, handled missing values, label encoding, dropped unnecessary  columns (e.g., Index, class for training).
-Train-Test Split: 80% training / 20% testing.
-Feature Reduction: Used PCA for dimensionality reduction.
-Model Training: Trained ANN, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers.
-Evaluation: Compared metrics ‚Äì Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
-Frontend: Built a full Streamlit UI for real-time interaction and insights.

ü§ñ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ‚Äì Deep learning-based classifier
üå≤ Random Forest (RF) ‚Äì Ensemble learning technique

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
-üìÅ Source: Kaggle Phishing Website Dataset
-üî¢ Features: 30 numerical features
-üéØ Target: class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Phishing)

üî¨ Evaluation Metrics
All models were evaluated using the test set (20% split) and compared on the following metrics:

| Metric     | Description                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy   | Overall correctness                                          |
| Precision  | Correct phishing predictions out of all predicted phishing  |
| Recall     | Correct phishing predictions out of all actual phishing     |
| F1-Score   | Harmonic mean of precision and recall                        |
| ROC-AUC    | Area under the ROC curve                                     |


The results are visualized in both table and bar chart formats.
